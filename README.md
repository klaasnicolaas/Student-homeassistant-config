# Make a Student Home 🏠 -> Smart 💡

You are probably wondering, what is Home Assistant!? Well, Home Assistant is a home automation platform running on Python 3. It is able to track and control all devices at home and offers a platform for automating control.

## Story

During student life there is often that one phase where you will live on your own, I recently took that step but with an important goal. You could almost say *"I am a man on a mission"*, because I want to make the 25m2 that I have a **super smart house**.
